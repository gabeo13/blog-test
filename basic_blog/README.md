# My First Blog
This project is my first tour through html and css. Contained within the 'basic_blog' directory, you will find a simple index.html file along with its' corresponding css styling, and some basic images scraped from the web along with a random user photo pull from [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/).

Thanks for stopping by and please feel free to browse through my other repositories.
